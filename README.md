## The Domain:
>contracting, receiving and invoicing for the supply of services

***
## The Idea:
>for **suppliers**: instant verification of receipt of invoices and associated funds receivable

>for **customers**: instant verification of payable against purchase order and receipt of service


The different transactions involved:
1.  Statement of Work (SoW) from supplier to customer, customer acceptance through issuing a Purchase Order
2.  Supplier issues progress reports (timesheets?), customer acceptance through confirming receipt of service
3.  Supplier issues invoice, customer matches invoice with receipt of services, customer pays invoice


Point 3 above is the one I want to focus on above, but I am not yet sure how far into 1 and 2 I need to include for practical purposes. However, for this project I will regard receipt of services as automatic/assumed and the benefit of this solution will be:
- confirmation of the identity of the invoice issuer, and 
- verification that the invoice has been paid
