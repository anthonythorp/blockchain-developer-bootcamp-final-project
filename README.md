>contracting, receiving and invoicing for the supply of services


## :bulb: The Idea:
***
For **suppliers**: 
- instant verification of receipt of invoices and associated funds receivable

For **customers**:
- instant verification of payable against purchase order and receipt of service

## :currency_exchange: Business process overview
***
The workflow involved in the contracting, supply and invoicing of services:
1.  Statement of Work (SoW) from supplier to customer, customer acceptance through issuing a Purchase Order
2.  Supplier issues progress reports (timesheets?), customer acceptance through confirming receipt of service
3.  Supplier issues invoice, customer matches invoice with receipt of services, customer pays invoice



Point 3 above is the one I want to focus on above, but I am not yet sure how far into 1 and 2 I need to include for practical purposes. However, for this project I will regard receipt of services as automatic/assumed and the benefit of this solution will be:
1. confirmation of the identity of the invoice issuer, and 
2. the invoice can only be issued once, and 
3. verification that the invoice has been paid (the invoice cannot be paid twice)
